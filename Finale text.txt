Hello my name is Gavin Hill. The reason why I made this website is because I enjoy watching people play basketball even little kids they are learning and when they grow up they want to get better. So I made this website to help them and showing them where to meet up to practice and who I represent. I enjoy teaching people or having fun with people showing their improvements.
